1. Both numbers change to the selected number
2. TRISE sets selected bits to I or O
TRISESET sets the predefined amount of bit to I or O
TRISCLR sets the defined number of bits to 0 (clearing the bits)
3. $s0
4. Demo


1. It resets the flag by executing IFS(0) = 0;
2. It would continuosly iterate the check flag sequence, it would always be 1
3. PR2
4. No, it takes a bit.


1. -||-
2. It would always stay as 1
3. ROW 209 vectors.s, because all interrupts are handled there
4. registers have to be pushed in case they are used during the execution, and the values would be changed.
in the end they have to be popped. Not all are saved because $s are save-registers, and
the value should not be changed
5. IPC and IEC, and processor-register v0. 


IEC=interrupt enable control
IPC=interrupt priority control
