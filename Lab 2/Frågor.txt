


1. pointer p increments m value by 1, fun() copies val of m to param and increments it and sets gv to the same value as param
2. 32 bits, i.e. 0xA0003FEC
3. Because it consists of 8 characters + nullbyte
4. "Program Flash". Data is binary machine code of the functions



1. In "virtual RAM"
2. In "Reserved", 
3. p address is A0003FE8 val == 7
4. p address is same as above, val == 8 because line 54, "*p = *p + 1;"
5. p sets val of cs to 1234abcd, cs[0]==CD, cs[4]==12, conclusion: machine is little endian



cs[0]
AM14
A0003FEC
CD

cs[3]
AM17
A0003FEF
12
